    <h2>Importance of HTML Headings</h2>
    <p>HTML heading tags are very important, not just for structuring content, but also for SEO. When you use headings on your page, search engines are able to better understand your page's content, and it also improves user experience.</p>
    
    <h3>Role of HTML Headings for SEO</h3>
    <p>Headings show the main points of your content to search engines. When search engine crawlers read your page, they analyze these heading tags to decide which sections are important. That’s why you should use <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for your main topic, and the other tags for sub-sections.</p>

    <h3>Semantic Meaning</h3>
    <p>Headings help structure your content. If you’re discussing multiple topics on one page, headings help users navigate through the content. They are also beneficial for accessibility, as screen readers use headings to help users understand the page structure.</p>

Always remember, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is the most important heading, and it should be used for the main title.</p>
